Say what you want but that website wasn't ever going to be used, so its not our problem AND it was already open source to begin with over at <a href="https://github.com/World-Of-Cars-Supercharged/wocs-site">https://github.com/World-Of-Cars-Supercharged/wocs-site</a>.

> We are so sorry to anyone who was effected by al3x's actions and Supercharged is still coming we're working on the revival, and we are making the website from scratch instead of stealing assets. 

lol idk what you are trying to say here but uh look for the file on google then if its "stolen"

> We promise to be more thorough in our decision behind who can lead a project, or be staff, because when it comes to the safety of our users, security is #1. Stay coolant.

Security is top priority? Well explain these images that elfbar had send then:<br>

That's not all. We have a dropbox full of images that contain proof of what you (elfbar) and Alexander have been doing.<br>
Anyways, stop accusing people without good proof and get you're fax right first Alexander.
<br>
P.S stop constantly saying you worked at ToonTown Rewritten without proof, you are just a troll elfbar/TewTow. (And yes elfbar you were dumb enough to have your full name on your gofundme, but for privacy we wont share you full name here)
